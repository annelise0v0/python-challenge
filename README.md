# Module 3 python-challenge

# Project Objective

This project consists of two Python-based data analysis tasks: PyBank and PyPoll. 
Each task represents a real-world scenario where Python scripting is utilized to automate data analysis.

# Project Description

PyBank Financial Analysis
Analyze the compamny's financial records from budget_data.csv to calculate the following:
    1. Total number of months in the dataset
    2. Net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
    3. Average change in "Profit.Losses" 
    4. Greatest increase in profits including date and dollar amount
    5. Greatest decrease in profits including data and dollar amount 

PyPoll Election Analysis
Modernize the vote-counting process using election_data.csv to calculate the following:
    1. Total number of votes cast
    2. Complete list of candidates who received votes
    3. The percentage of votes each candidate won
    4. The total number of votes each candidate won
    5. The winner of the election based on popular vote
